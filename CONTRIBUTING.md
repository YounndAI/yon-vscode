# Contributing to the YON VS Code extension

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the YON VS Code extension, a
YounndAI™ product by MARLINK TRADING SRL.

This repository contains the VS Code extension for YON language support —
syntax highlighting, snippets, and language configuration for the
[YON specification](https://github.com/YounndAI/yon-spec). It is published to
the VS Code Marketplace and the Open VSX Registry as `yon` (publisher
**YounndAI**).

## Contributor License Agreement (REQUIRED)

Before we can accept your contribution, we need you to sign a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA). The CLA is a one-time legal document that confirms:

- You have the right to grant us the license terms specified in the CLA
- You grant us a broad, perpetual license to use, modify, and re-license your contribution
- You receive no special contributor rights: no royalties, governance, trademark rights, private license-back, approval rights, or claims against future relicensing or posture changes
- Your contribution is provided "as is" without warranty

### Which CLA do I sign?

- **[Individual CLA](CLA.md)** — if you are contributing on your own behalf, on
  your own time, and your employer has no claim to your intellectual-property
  output.
- **[Entity CLA](CLA-entity.md)** — if you are contributing as an employee or
  contractor on behalf of an employer or organization. The Entity CLA covers all
  contributors your organization authorizes (listed in its Schedule A). Questions:
  office@younndai.com.

If you are unsure, sign the Individual CLA — and request the Entity CLA as well
if an employer may have a claim to your work.

### How to sign

When you open your first pull request, our [CLA bot](https://cla-assistant.io)
will comment with a link to sign. You can sign electronically via GitHub OAuth
— no paperwork required. Once signed, your future contributions are
automatically covered. **Pull requests cannot be merged until the CLA bot
confirms a signed CLA is on file for all contributors.**

## Development

There is no build step — the extension is declarative (grammar, snippets,
language configuration). Test changes by loading the folder as a VS Code
extension development host (`F5` from VS Code) or packaging locally:

```bash
npx @vscode/vsce package   # produces a local .vsix (never commit it)
```

The TextMate grammar itself is maintained in
[yon-textmate](https://github.com/YounndAI/yon-textmate); grammar fixes
usually belong there first.
